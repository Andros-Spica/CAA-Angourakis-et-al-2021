Abstract:

We present the Indus Village, an agent-based model addressing the potential diversity of agricultural strategies adopted by rural settlements in different socio-ecological scenarios. This work is part of a multi-disciplinary project focused on untangling the relationship between climate change and the emergence and decline of the Indus Civilisation's urban phase (c. 2500 to 1900 BC), which spanned areas with extraordinarily diverse and variable environments. The abandonment of most Indus urban settlements at the end of this period has been associated with the regional-to-local consequences of the 4.2 ka BP climate change event. Therefore, modelling the socio-ecological mechanisms acting in this makes the Indus Civilisation an opportunity to examine how early complex societies responded to climate change events.
The Indus Village model aims to assess the implications of different food production strategies for the sustainability of the urban population and the resilience of these in the face of changes in the intensity and variability of winter and summer water availability (Petrie and Bates 2017). We are particularly interested in exploring how Indus farmers coped with diverse and changing environments and how climate change could impact regional food production levels required for maintaining urban centres. The model was constructed following a modular philosophy and combines modelling contributions from many fields and methodological backgrounds (e.g., Jones 2007, Zhao et al. 2019). 
As suggested by its name, the Indus Village model represents all processes at a local scale (5-10 km2) and a single rural, food-producing settlement (i.e., a village). The model represents (1) a population structured in households with explicit individual-based variables and dynamics, (2) a landscape where weather, soil conditions, and human actions converge into a multi-crop system, and (3) an algorithm representing hypothetical decision-making rules regarding the selection and modification of cropping strategies. 
We present the results of various simulation experiments, highlighting the capacity of the Indus Village model to generate insights on the resilience of pre-industrial food production systems to the diversity and variability of environmental conditions and particularly climate change. Specifically, our experiments focus on the interplay between diversity and maximisation of crop yield, and how it relates to environmental scenarios and population size.
Moreover, the potential utility of this model goes beyond the goals of our project. We believe it could serve as a reference or template for the modelling community in history and archaeology. In this sense, our constant concern is to make all materials related to the Indus Village accessible and reproducible to future generations.
